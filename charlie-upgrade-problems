eth1 didn't exist on boot
(unplug / plug required)

therefore? systemd locked
kernel needs "systemd.debug-shell" arg

bind9 started even though not started in any runlevel


/etc/network/if-up.d/local-exim4 - commented out the exim4 startup
even though /something/ seemed to have started exim4
(runlevel 2,3?)

firefox not using proxy
(but chrome is)


exim.org no longer pings, just to confuse me!
